	abstract = {Structures in which electrons are confined to move in two dimensions (quantum wells) have led to new physical discoveries and technological applications. Modification of these structures to confine the electrons to one dimension (quantum wires) or release them in the third dimension, are predicted to lead to new electrical and optical properties. This article discusses techniques to make quantum wires, and quantum wells of controlled size and shape, from compound semiconductor materials, and describes some of the properties of these structures.},
